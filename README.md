# RandomPasswordGenerator
This is a simple python program that can help you generate passwords on the go without thinking about it much
You just need to enter the desired length of the password you want to generate and voila the password will be generated.
There are 2 versions of the v1.0
The first one is basically where I have added some elements to make program a bit more appealing.
And the second one is the main logic without any BS :p 

NOTE for v1.0: This is the first version of the project so there aren't much features in the project so expect a few more features being added into this as the time goes by and my knowledge increases :)
