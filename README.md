# RandomPasswordGenerator
This is a simple python program that can help you generate passwords on the go without thinking about it much
You just need to enter the desired length of the password you want to generate and voila the password will be generated.

NOTE for v1.0: This is the first version of the project so there aren't much features in the project so expect a few more features being added into this as the time goes by and my knowledge increases :)
